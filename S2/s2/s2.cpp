// s2.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

//function data type returns the data type of result
//void functions do not return any value
//the OS runs the main function in an application
//functions with a data type other than void must return a value, always.
//EXCEPTION: good practice to have main as int, due to the OS needing a return type when running the app.

int main() 
{
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
}

//2 different functions with the same name can have multiple data types, and will run their specific data type function code
//int f1(..)
//char f1(..)
