1 byte = 8 bits

Variable types:
-char - 1 byte
-int - 4 bytes
-float - 4 bytes
-long - 8 bytes
-double - 8 bytes

-pointers on x86 > 4 bytes
-pointers on x64 > 8 bytes










*bool is an integer, not a type
-bool   > int > 4 bytes (x86)
	> int > 8 bytes (x64)

breakpoints stops the execution BEFORE the line that it is pointing to.
F10 to execute the line after the dot and move it down a line.
Shift+11 go out of a function


_getch(); >> keeps the terminal open
get ch means get character, meaning it will wait for user input on keyboard before closing.



Compiler errors:
unresolved external symbol = program does not know what to do with the variable in the function aka invalid function
